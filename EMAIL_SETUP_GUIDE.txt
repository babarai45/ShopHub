PASSWORD RESET EMAIL - SETUP & TESTING

CURRENT SETUP:
  Email Backend: File-based (saves to sent_emails/ folder)
  This is perfect for development testing

HOW IT WORKS:

1. User visits /password-reset/
2. Enters their email address
3. Clicks "Reset Password"
4. Email is generated and saved to: sent_emails/ folder
5. Success page shows: "Email Sent! Check your email..."

BUT WAIT - WHERE IS MY EMAIL?

In development mode, emails are NOT sent to your actual email inbox.
Instead, they are saved as files on your computer.

HOW TO VIEW PASSWORD RESET EMAILS:

Method 1: View Email Files
  1. Open file explorer
  2. Navigate to: E:\8th_semester\SEP\SepApp\sent_emails\
  3. Look for files like: 20251130-052345-1234567890.log
  4. Open with notepad to see the full email content
  5. Look for the password reset link

Method 2: Terminal Command
  cd E:\8th_semester\SEP\SepApp\sent_emails\
  dir
  (Lists all saved emails)

Method 3: View Email in Text Editor
  1. Open any file from sent_emails/ folder with notepad
  2. Look for the line starting with: "http://" or "https://"
  3. That's your password reset link!

WHAT IF EMAILS AREN'T SHOWING UP?

Check 1: Is sent_emails folder created?
  Directory should exist: E:\8th_semester\SEP\SepApp\sent_emails\
  If not, create it manually

Check 2: Restart Django Server
  Stop server with Ctrl+C
  Run: python manage.py runserver 8000

Check 3: Check Settings.py
  Verify: EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.filebased.EmailBackend'
  Verify: EMAIL_FILE_PATH = BASE_DIR / 'sent_emails'

Check 4: Reload Page
  After submitting form, refresh browser
  Check sent_emails folder again

SWITCHING EMAIL BACKENDS:

For Console Output (emails in terminal):
  In settings.py, change:
  EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend'

  Then run server and check terminal output for email content

For Gmail (Production):
  In settings.py, add:
  EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
  EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
  EMAIL_PORT = 587
  EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
  EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'your-email@gmail.com'
  EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'your-app-password'

  Note: For Gmail, use "App Password", not your regular password

IMPORTANT NOTES:

1. Development Mode
   - Emails don't go to real inboxes
   - They're stored locally on your computer
   - Perfect for testing!

2. The email link works
   - Even though email isn't real
   - The reset token is valid
   - You can reset your password!

3. Email content is complete
   - All fields are filled correctly
   - Username, subject, everything is there
   - Ready to test!
