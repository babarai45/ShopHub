PASSWORD RESET URL FIX - COMPLETED

ERROR FIXED:
  NoReverseMatch at /password-reset/
  'password_reset_done' is not a valid view function or pattern name

ROOT CAUSE:
  Django's PasswordResetView was looking for 'password_reset_done' URL
  But the actual name is 'ecommerce:password_reset_done' (with app namespace)

SOLUTION:
  Added success_url parameter to password reset views using reverse_lazy
  This tells Django where to redirect after form submission

FILES MODIFIED:
  ✓ ecommerce/urls.py
    - Added: reverse_lazy import
    - Added: success_url to PasswordResetView
    - Added: success_url to PasswordResetConfirmView

CHANGES MADE:
  PasswordResetView: Added success_url=reverse_lazy('ecommerce:password_reset_done')
  PasswordResetConfirmView: Added success_url=reverse_lazy('ecommerce:password_reset_complete')

VERIFICATION:
  ✓ All password reset URLs resolve correctly
  ✓ No reverse lookup errors
  ✓ Password reset flow functional

URLS NOW WORKING:
  ✓ /password-reset/ → form page
  ✓ /password-reset/done/ → confirmation page
  ✓ /password-reset/<token>/ → reset form
  ✓ /password-reset/complete/ → success page

PASSWORD RESET FLOW:
  1. User visits /password-reset/
  2. Enters email and submits form
  3. Gets redirected to /password-reset/done/
  4. Email sent with password reset link
  5. User clicks link in email
  6. Opens /password-reset/<token>/ form
  7. Enters new password and submits
  8. Gets redirected to /password-reset/complete/
  9. Successfully logged in with new password

SYSTEM STATUS:
  ✓ Django check: PASSED
  ✓ All password reset URLs: WORKING
  ✓ URL redirects: FUNCTIONAL
  ✓ Ready to use

READY FOR USE: YES
