✓ PASSWORD RESET WORKS!

KEY POINTS:

- Emails aren't sent to your inbox (development mode)
- They're saved in sent_emails/ folder
- The password reset link is real and works
- You can reset any user's password this way
- Perfect for testing!

MULTIPLE RESETS:

Each time you request a password reset:
- A new email file is created in sent_emails/
- The newest file is the latest request
- Each file is independent
- Multiple files can exist at once

TROUBLESHOOTING:

No .log file in sent_emails/?
  1. Did you submit the form? (click button!)
  2. Is sent_emails/ folder created? (should exist in project root)
  3. Restart Django server (stop with Ctrl+C, run again)
  4. Clear browser cache and reload

Link doesn't work?
  1. Make sure Django server is running
  2. Check the URL has no typos
  3. Check your network/firewall isn't blocking
  4. Restart server and try again

That's it! Your password reset is fully working! 🎉
